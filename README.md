# GM_automation

# Project objective: To develop and evaluate a script to automate data collection for Geometric Morphometrics (GM) of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).

# Note: This project was developed for a specific environment and includes some hardcoded file paths. It is not currently fully portable, but the code and structure reflect my approach to automating GM and its potential in transforming the efficiency and scope of research.
